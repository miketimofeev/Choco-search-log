 Summary: The 'cabal' command-line program simplifies the process of managing Haskell software by automating the fetching, configuration, compilation and installation of Haskell libraries and programs.
 Description: The 'cabal.exe' command-line program simplifies the process of managing Haskell software by automating the fetching, configuration, compilation and installation of Haskell libraries and programs.

      Cabal is a system for building and packaging Haskell libraries and programs. It defines a common interface for package authors and distributors to easily build their applications in a portable way. Cabal is part of a larger infrastructure for distributing, organizing, and cataloging Haskell libraries and programs.

  Specifically, the Cabal describes what a Haskell package is, how these packages interact with the language, and what Haskell implementations must to do to support packages. The Cabal also specifies some infrastructure (code) that makes it easy for tool authors to build and distribute conforming packages.

  The Cabal is only one contribution to the larger goal. In particular, the Cabal says nothing about more global issues such as how authors decide where in the module name space their library should live; how users can find a package they want; how orphan packages find new owners; and so on.

It defines a common interface for package authors and distributors to easily build their applications in a portable way. Cabal is part of a larger infrastructure for distributing, organizing, and cataloging Haskell libraries and programs.

  Specifically, the Cabal describes what a Haskell package is, how these packages interact with the language, and what Haskell implementations must to do to support packages. The Cabal also specifies some infrastructure (code) that makes it easy for tool authors to build and distribute conforming packages.

  The Cabal is only one contribution to the larger goal. In particular, the Cabal says nothing about more global issues such as how authors decide where in the module name space their library should live; how users can find a package they want; how orphan packages find new owners; and so on.

 Summary: The 'cabal' command-line program simplifies the process of managing Haskell software by automating the fetching, configuration, compilation and installation of Haskell libraries and programs.
 Description: The 'cabal.exe' command-line program simplifies the process of managing Haskell software by automating the fetching, configuration, compilation and installation of Haskell libraries and programs.

      Cabal is a system for building and packaging Haskell libraries and programs. It defines a common interface for package authors and distributors to easily build their applications in a portable way. Cabal is part of a larger infrastructure for distributing, organizing, and cataloging Haskell libraries and programs.

  Specifically, the Cabal describes what a Haskell package is, how these packages interact with the language, and what Haskell implementations must to do to support packages. The Cabal also specifies some infrastructure (code) that makes it easy for tool authors to build and distribute conforming packages.

  The Cabal is only one contribution to the larger goal. In particular, the Cabal says nothing about more global issues such as how authors decide where in the module name space their library should live; how users can find a package they want; how orphan packages find new owners; and so on.

          There's an important change to path handling for Windows starting with 8.6.1.
          These changes mean that Haskell programs are no longer constraint to `MAX_PATH`.  So passing a long path to `openFile` will just work.
          There are a few caveats to this such as you can't access `COM` devices via `COM1` etc anymore and instead need to use the full path `\\.\COM1` etc.
          This is all documented https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/8.6.4/docs/html/users_guide/win32-dlls.html#windows-file-paths

 Summary: GHC is a state-of-the-art, open source, compiler and interactive environment for the functional language Haskell.
 Description: Highlights:
          • GHC supports the entire Haskell 2010 language plus a wide variety of extensions.
          • GHC has particularly good support for concurrency and parallelism, including support for Software Transactional Memory (STM).
          • GHC generates fast code, particularly for concurrent programs. Take a look at GHC's performance on The Computer Language Benchmarks Game.
          • GHC works on several platforms including Windows, Mac, Linux, most varieties of Unix, and several different processor architectures. There are detailed instructions for porting GHC to a new platform.
          • GHC has extensive optimisation capabilities, including inter-module optimisation.
          • GHC compiles Haskell code either directly to native code or using LLVM as a back-end. GHC can also generate C code as an intermediate target for porting to new platforms. The interactive environment compiles Haskell to bytecode, and supports execution of mixed bytecode/compiled programs.
          • Profiling is supported, both by time/allocation and various kinds of heap profiling.
          • GHC comes with several libraries, and thousands more are available on Hackage.

          There's an important change to path handling for Windows starting with 8.6.1.
          These changes mean that Haskell programs are no longer constraint to `MAX_PATH`.  So passing a long path to `openFile` will just work.
          There are a few caveats to this such as you can't access `COM` devices via `COM1` etc anymore and instead need to use the full path `\\.\COM1` etc.

          There's an important change to path handling for Windows starting with 8.6.1.
          These changes mean that Haskell programs are no longer constraint to `MAX_PATH`.  So passing a long path to `openFile` will just work.
          There are a few caveats to this such as you can't access `COM` devices via `COM1` etc anymore and instead need to use the full path `\\.\COM1` etc.
          This is all documented https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/8.8.4/docs/html/users_guide/win32-dlls.html#windows-file-paths

          *32-bit Windows is no longer supported and installing this package on 32-bit Windows will install GHC 8.6.5.*

  ### Package Specific
  #### Package Parameters
  The following package parameters can be set:

   * `/installdir:` - The location to install package to.  Note that installing to a directory with spaces will likely lead to difficulties.
   * `/globalinstall:` - Indicates whether package should be installed for current user or all users.

  To pass parameters, use `--params "''"` (e.g. `choco install packageID [other options] --params="'/ITEM:value /ITEM2:value2 /FLAG_BOOLEAN'"`).
  To have choco remember parameters on upgrade, be sure to set `choco feature enable -n=useRememberedArgumentsForUpgrades`.

 Summary: GHC is a state-of-the-art, open source, compiler and interactive environment for the functional language Haskell.
 Description: Highlights:
          • GHC supports the entire Haskell 2010 language plus a wide variety of extensions.
          • GHC has particularly good support for concurrency and parallelism, including support for Software Transactional Memory (STM).
          • GHC generates fast code, particularly for concurrent programs. Take a look at GHC's performance on The Computer Language Benchmarks Game.
          • GHC works on several platforms including Windows, Mac, Linux, most varieties of Unix, and several different processor architectures. There are detailed instructions for porting GHC to a new platform.
          • GHC has extensive optimisation capabilities, including inter-module optimisation.
          • GHC compiles Haskell code either directly to native code or using LLVM as a back-end. GHC can also generate C code as an intermediate target for porting to new platforms. The interactive environment compiles Haskell to bytecode, and supports execution of mixed bytecode/compiled programs.
          • Profiling is supported, both by time/allocation and various kinds of heap profiling.
          • GHC comes with several libraries, and thousands more are available on Hackage.

 Description: Highlights:
          • GHC supports the entire Haskell 2010 language plus a wide variety of extensions.
          • GHC has particularly good support for concurrency and parallelism, including support for Software Transactional Memory (STM).
          • GHC generates fast code, particularly for concurrent programs. Take a look at GHC's performance on The Computer Language Benchmarks Game.
          • GHC works on several platforms including Windows, Mac, Linux, most varieties of Unix, and several different processor architectures. There are detailed instructions for porting GHC to a new platform.
          • GHC has extensive optimisation capabilities, including inter-module optimisation.
          • GHC compiles Haskell code either directly to native code or using LLVM as a back-end. GHC can also generate C code as an intermediate target for porting to new platforms. The interactive environment compiles Haskell to bytecode, and supports execution of mixed bytecode/compiled programs.
          • Profiling is supported, both by time/allocation and various kinds of heap profiling.
          • GHC comes with several libraries, and thousands more are available on Hackage.

          There's an important change to path handling for Windows starting with 8.6.1.
          These changes mean that Haskell programs are no longer constraint to `MAX_PATH`.  So passing a long path to `openFile` will just work.
          There are a few caveats to this such as you can't access `COM` devices via `COM1` etc anymore and instead need to use the full path `\\.\COM1` etc.
          This is all documented https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/8.8.4/docs/html/users_guide/win32-dlls.html#windows-file-paths

          *32-bit Windows is no longer supported and installing this package on 32-bit Windows will install GHC 8.6.5.*

  ### Package Specific
  ### changes

   * Contains workaround for broken GHC 8.10.2 linker PATHs.
   * Adds support for Azure Pipelines.

  #### Package Parameters
  The following package parameters can be set:

   * `/installdir:` - The location to install package to.  Note that installing to a directory with spaces will likely lead to difficulties.
   * `/globalinstall:` - Indicates whether package should be installed for current user or all users.

  To pass parameters, use `--params "''"` (e.g. `choco install packageID [other options] --params="'/ITEM:value /ITEM2:value2 /FLAG_BOOLEAN'"`).
  To have choco remember parameters on upgrade, be sure to set `choco feature enable -n=useRememberedArgumentsForUpgrades`.

 Summary: GHC is a state-of-the-art, open source, compiler and interactive environment for the functional language Haskell.
 Description: Highlights:
          • GHC supports the entire Haskell 2010 language plus a wide variety of extensions.
          • GHC has particularly good support for concurrency and parallelism, including support for Software Transactional Memory (STM).
          • GHC generates fast code, particularly for concurrent programs. Take a look at GHC's performance on The Computer Language Benchmarks Game.
          • GHC works on several platforms including Windows, Mac, Linux, most varieties of Unix, and several different processor architectures. There are detailed instructions for porting GHC to a new platform.
          • GHC has extensive optimisation capabilities, including inter-module optimisation.
          • GHC compiles Haskell code either directly to native code or using LLVM as a back-end. GHC can also generate C code as an intermediate target for porting to new platforms. The interactive environment compiles Haskell to bytecode, and supports execution of mixed bytecode/compiled programs.
          • Profiling is supported, both by time/allocation and various kinds of heap profiling.
          • GHC comes with several libraries, and thousands more are available on Hackage.

          *NOTE: This package contains only the compiler. If you are looking to setup a system from scratch please look at `haskell-dev` instead.

          There's an important change to path handling for Windows starting with 8.6.1.
          These changes mean that Haskell programs are no longer constraint to `MAX_PATH`.  So passing a long path to `openFile` will just work.
          There are a few caveats to this such as you can't access `COM` devices via `COM1` etc anymore and instead need to use the full path `\\.\COM1` etc.
          This is all documented https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/8.6.5/docs/html/users_guide/win32-dlls.html#windows-file-paths

   * Contains workaround for broken GHC 8.10.2 linker PATHs.
   * Adds support for Azure Pipelines.

  #### Package Parameters
  The following package parameters can be set:

   * `/installdir:` - The location to install package to.  Note that installing to a directory with spaces will likely lead to difficulties.
   * `/globalinstall:` - Indicates whether package should be installed for current user or all users.

  To pass parameters, use `--params "''"` (e.g. `choco install packageID [other options] --params="'/ITEM:value /ITEM2:value2 /FLAG_BOOLEAN'"`).
  To have choco remember parameters on upgrade, be sure to set `choco feature enable -n=useRememberedArgumentsForUpgrades`.

 Summary: GHC is a state-of-the-art, open source, compiler and interactive environment for the functional language Haskell.
 Description: Highlights:
          • GHC supports the entire Haskell 2010 language plus a wide variety of extensions.
          • GHC has particularly good support for concurrency and parallelism, including support for Software Transactional Memory (STM).
          • GHC generates fast code, particularly for concurrent programs. Take a look at GHC's performance on The Computer Language Benchmarks Game.
          • GHC works on several platforms including Windows, Mac, Linux, most varieties of Unix, and several different processor architectures. There are detailed instructions for porting GHC to a new platform.
          • GHC has extensive optimisation capabilities, including inter-module optimisation.
          • GHC compiles Haskell code either directly to native code or using LLVM as a back-end. GHC can also generate C code as an intermediate target for porting to new platforms. The interactive environment compiles Haskell to bytecode, and supports execution of mixed bytecode/compiled programs.
          • Profiling is supported, both by time/allocation and various kinds of heap profiling.
          • GHC comes with several libraries, and thousands more are available on Hackage.

          There's an important change to path handling for Windows starting with 8.6.1.
          These changes mean that Haskell programs are no longer constraint to `MAX_PATH`.  So passing a long path to `openFile` will just work.
          There are a few caveats to this such as you can't access `COM` devices via `COM1` etc anymore and instead need to use the full path `\\.\COM1` etc.

 Summary: Complete Haskell development environment using Cabal.
 Description: This is an opinionated automated environment for performing Haskell development on windows
      using GHC and Cabal along with MSYS2.  The goal of the project is to create as minimal of
      indirections between you and the tools as possible in order to simplify things and make
      things easier to understand and debug.  The core premise of the project is to integrate into
      Windows and not box off or isolate Haskell tools from other tools while using no or as few
      global state as possible.

      This package will automatically configure msys2 for use by cabal.  If you already have msys2
      install then nothing else needs to be done. Otherwise msys2 will be installed for you.

      Lastly in order to facilitate package installations a new CmdLet `mingw64-pkg` is created to make it easier to install
      native dependencies such as `gtk`.

          C:\PS> mingw-pkg install gtk2

      This CmdLet makes it easier to install native Mingw-w64 packages into MSYS2 such
      that cabal-install and GHC can use them without any other configuration required.

      This will not allow installation of MSYS2 packages.  Your global namespace will
      not be poluted by the use of this CmdLet.

      The action to perform. Must be one of install, uninstall, update or shell.

      - install: install a new native package
      - uninstall: remove native package
      - update: sync the repositories, will not upgrade any packages.
      - shell: open a bash shell

      An optional last parameter can be used to force a prompt before installing a package.
      Default is off.

          C:\PS> mingw-pkg install gtk2 $true

      For AppVeyor use we recommend installing the ghc and cabal packages directly as to not install msys2 twice.
      You will still have access to mingw-pkg.

 Summary: Stack is a cross-platform program for developing Haskell projects
 Description: Stack is a cross-platform build tool for Haskell that handles management of the toolchain (including the GHC compiler and MSYS2 on Windows), building and registering libraries, and more.

  ## Features

  * Installing GHC automatically, in an isolated location.
  * Installing packages needed for your project.
  * Building your project.
  * Testing your project.
  * Benchmarking your project.

  The links provided with the package are related to The Haskell Tool Stack, if you're looking for help learning Haskell itself, start with the [Documentation](https://www.haskell.org/documentation).

  ## Package parameters

  The following package parameters can be set:

  * `NoLocalBinOnPath` - this disables putting %APPDATA%\local\bin on Path. You usually want this if you configure your local-bin-path to other than the default.
  * `NoStackRoot` - this disables setting STACK_ROOT to %SystemDrive%\sr (e.g. C:\sr) to workaround issues with long paths. It is recommended that you leave this enabled.

  These parameters can be passed to the installer with the use of `-params`.
  For example: `-params '"/NoLocalBinOnPath /NoStackRoot"'`.

 Summary: Stack is a cross-platform program for developing Haskell projects
 Description: Stack is a cross-platform build tool for Haskell that handles management of the toolchain (including the GHC compiler and MSYS2 on Windows), building and registering libraries, and more.

  ## Features

  * Installing GHC automatically, in an isolated location.
  * Installing packages needed for your project.
  * Building your project.
  * Testing your project.
  * Benchmarking your project.

  The links provided with the package are related to The Haskell Tool Stack, if you're looking for help learning Haskell itself, start with the [Documentation](https://www.haskell.org/documentation).

  ## Package parameters

  The following package parameters can be set:

  * `NoLocalBinOnPath` - this disables putting `%APPDATA%\local\bin` on Path. You usually want this if you configure your local-bin-path to other than the default.
  * `NoStackRoot` - this disables setting `STACK_ROOT` to `%SystemDrive%\sr` (e.g. `C:\sr`) to workaround issues with long paths. It is recommended that you leave this enabled.

  These parameters can be passed to the installer with the use of `-params`.
  For example: `-params '"/NoLocalBinOnPath /NoStackRoot"'`.

  * Building your project.
  * Testing your project.
  * Benchmarking your project.

  The links provided with the package are related to The Haskell Tool Stack, if you're looking for help learning Haskell itself, start with the [Documentation](https://www.haskell.org/documentation).

  ## Package parameters

  The following package parameters can be set:

  * `NoLocalBinOnPath` - this disables putting `%APPDATA%\local\bin` on Path. You usually want this if you configure your local-bin-path to other than the default.
  * `NoStackRoot` - this disables setting `STACK_ROOT` to `%SystemDrive%\sr` (e.g. `C:\sr`) to workaround issues with long paths. It is recommended that you leave this enabled.

  These parameters can be passed to the installer with the use of `-params`.
  For example: `-params '"/NoLocalBinOnPath /NoStackRoot"'`.

 Summary: A Dependently Typed Functional Programming Language
 Description: **From** http://www.idris-lang.org :

  "Idris is a general purpose pure functional programming language with dependent types. Dependent types allow types to be predicated on values, meaning that some aspects of a program's behaviour can be specified precisely in the type. It is compiled, with eager evaluation. Its features are influenced by Haskell and ML, ..."

  You can find the full feature list and comprehensive documentation at the link above and the [Idris-dev Github wiki](https://github.com/idris-lang/Idris-dev/wiki).

  **Chocolatey Idris** is not affiliated with the Idris project and does not include a copy of Idris. It just automatically downloads and installs the Idris [Windows binary distribution](https://github.com/idris-lang/Idris-dev/wiki/Windows-Binaries).

  ### INFOS

  Chocolatey Idris automatically installs either the 32bit or 64bit Idris distribution.

  The Idris archive will be extracted to the Chocolatey package's **tools\\** sub-directory (usually **C:\\ProgramData\\chocolatey\\lib\\idris\\tools\\**), and Chocolatey will create shims for **idris.exe** and all **idris-codegen-*.exe** files, so that they are available in `%PATH%`.

  On updating or uninstalling, the (old) Idris distribution will be deleted together with the (old) Chocolatey package files.
